# Release 1zeta

Sixth test release.

Use v11 of the Nix SDE package.  This provides support for the Debian
11.0 kernel and improves the error handling of the release-manager. It
also changes the name of the management ethernet interface to "mgmt0"
from the platform-dependent udev-based default.

The ONIE installer for this release uses Debian 11.0 as the base
system.

**Do not use in production **
